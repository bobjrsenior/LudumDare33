Ideas:

Chase cats and other things

2d maze or 3d maze?

run away from the hero

make maze algorithm: row and collumn * block size = location in game

have other enemies randomly spawn and hurt the hero. Last until thew hero dies

make characters a little smaller than min space between walls for better movement


Enemy:
HP
DPS?
movement speed


Hero:
HP
DPS
movement speed
Upgrades with each monster kill for difficulty scaling?



Items:

Speed
Enemy Spawn Rate
Jumping blocks?
Stunning hero(bullet or melee)?


Maze:
2d array
0 = free
1 = enemy
2 = hero
3 = wall
4 = spike //DPS when standing on


Collision:
Find adjacent positions in maze array and check for collisions.
